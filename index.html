        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Media & Cultural StudiesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Devora Avila is currently a third-year student at UC Riverside studying Media & Cultural Studies. After taking an intro class to her major, she became fascinated and passionate about learning the impact of Media has in our society. In her studies, she has acquired a 3.8 GPA and is involved in campus life. She is a member of a campus club, Underground Scholars, and attends regular meetings. Underground Scholars supports people affected by the incarceration system and constantly holds community events. Outside of school, she is a part of an internship program, called Avalon Fashion Group, where she gets the opportunity to speak with experts in the fashion industry and provide her opinions regarding fashion trends. Each month, she collects images of fashion trends and constructs a well-made collage with all her findings acquired from various social media platforms, including Instagram, Pinterest, and Tiktok. She also responds to frequent data questionnaires, such as polls or google forms. 
  <br><br>

        As a young girl, Devora wished to become a doctor when she grew up. She wanted to help people and believed becoming a doctor was the easiest way to help people in the world. As she grew older and came to know herself better, she realized that becoming a doctor was not for her. However, she still wanted to help other people and make a difference in the world. Of course, everyone wishes to make a mark in the world; but, Devora was serious about making a difference. Growing up, Devora did not see lots of representation in the media. In the media, she saw most opportunities to showcase lighter skin tones and individuals of a white background. For this reason, she wishes to become involved in the public relations field. Devora believes she can be a great help to making the public media a more welcoming place to all people. She believes by working in public relations, she can make significant decisions to construct more inclusive projects. Then, children of color growing up can finally grow to see representation where they feel included and seen.
<br><br>

     After graduating with her bachelorâ€™s degree, Devora will dive into the communications work field. She wishes to gain more internship experience and gain more knowledge working in public relations. If the possibility arises, she also wishes to continue her schooling and get her masters in communications. Growing up in the world of social media, Devora became highly interested in the enormous world of Public Relations. Her major courses have helped her learn more about media and its significant power. For instance, in mcs111, she has learned the history of media theory. That course has specifically helped her understand the power of propaganda and the various media theories in existence. She is a passionate learner and is always curious to learn more about her work and the work of others. She promises to be an excited learner and always does her very best to showcase her potential. Devora is excited for the future and is excited to be part of a significant, impactful, growing field.
